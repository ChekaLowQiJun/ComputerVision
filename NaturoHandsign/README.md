In this project, I developed my own dataset from scratch using Roboflow. I collected images of Naruto Handsigns taken at differnet angles, lighting and backgrounds. I then used Roboflow to label the images and draw bouding boxes. Thereafter, I applied image augmentation
to the dataset, by rotating the images and playing around with their brightness. I then loaded the YoloV8n model and trained it with my custom dataset for 50 epochs. After training, I deployed the model to my webcam, for testing. NOTE: Please do not use my dataset without 
first seeking permission. You can drop me an email at chekalowqijun@gmail.com if you would like to use said dataset. Happy coding!
